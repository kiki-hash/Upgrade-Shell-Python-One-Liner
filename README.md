# Upgrade-Shell-Python-One-Liner
A simple Python One-liner to upgrade your shell.

Basically, if you have acquired a shell on a Linux device, you can use this simple one-liner to upgrade your shell to the user. Saved my bacon a LOT.

I can not take credit for creation of this one-liner.

Credit to the Hack The Box team and the cheat sheet available on the Getting Started module.

Whoever wrote the cheat sheet, you are awesome and much appreciated.
